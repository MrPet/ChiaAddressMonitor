# Chia address monitor & forks

With this widget, you can always check your chia [blockchain™](https://www.chia.net) or Forks address balance. If you are like me you always like to know if your farm was lucky in the last hours.

The Widget will be refreshed by the widget api, this can result in irregular updates but will not drain your battery. If you need a quick update you can refresh the widget manually in the app. Just pull the list of addresses to refresh all.

This widget uses the API of [AllTheBlocks.net](https://alltheblocks.net), big thanks for doing the heavy lifting and providing the data for easy access.

This is a beta version and is developed in my free time, please keep that in mind.
